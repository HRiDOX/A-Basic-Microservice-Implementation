#But to be honest with you, a deployment kind of has a hard time figuring out which pods it should manage

#inside of our cluster.

#In other words, if a set of pods get created, we have to somehow give the deployment some information

#and tell it, Hey, these pods over here 

#These are the ones you need to manage.

#And that's what the goal of this selector and metadata labels app thing is all about.
